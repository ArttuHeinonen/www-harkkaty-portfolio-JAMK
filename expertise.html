			<h1>Programming languages and tools</h1>
			<h2>General computer skills</h2>
			<p>
				I've been working with computer over a decade and I know my way around them quite well. I can operate countless programs including: Microsoft office, compilers, project management tools, etc.<br>

			<h2>Expertise with programming languages</h2>
			<p>
				I also have expertise with programming languages such as:
			</p>
			<h4>C/C++</h4>
			<p>
				C++ is maybe my favorite programming languages. I've worked with C++ mostly around school projects. I've created 3 game projects with C++, which one of them was made with SFML 2.1 multimedia library. See my projects page for more information.
			</p>
			<h4>Java</h4>
			<p>
				With Java I've created a few games and few Android projects. Java is my second most used language.
			</p>
			<h4>Visual Basic</h4>
			<p>
				With Visual Basic, I've worked with as quality controller and tester in big company.
			</p>
			<h4>C#</h4>
			<p>
				I've used C# to develop one certain generic computer program I worked for small team. I was mostly in charge of making the program UI and simpler logic.
